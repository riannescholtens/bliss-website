	<h6>International media & Entertainment student, CEO Bliss</h6>
	<br>
	 <p>"I think every women should be proud of herself. I think it's terrible a woman feeling unhappy because she's not happy with herself or doesn't love herself enough. Unfortunately, there are so many women who carry this feeling mostly because of social media. How nice is it when women support each other instead of competing with each other? That's why I love this brand and I loved to work on it. Together with the other CEOs, we want to get rid of the uncertainty among young women. It would be a great experience to see the transformation of these women at the end of the retreat!"</p>

    <h3>Iris Severens</h3>
	<h6>International media & Entertainment student, CEO Bliss</h6>
	<br>
    <p>"I helped with the making of Bliss because when I look around me, I see so many insecure women talking themselves down because they don’t look like the girls online and on tv. I wanted to change that. I wanted to make these women see that they are just as amazing and beautiful as the girls in the pictures. I wanted to make them realise that there is no need to compare yourself to others because you yourself are the best person you can be. I want this brand to show people how important it is to believe in yourself and how focussing on yourself can change your attitude. 
I hope that with this brand we can help people to regain their confidence and to realise that focussing on yourself will help you gain your happiness."</p>

	<p>"The reason why I wanted to be a part of Bliss is because I believe women should feel good in their bodies and they have the right to spend time on building themselves and making themselves proud of who they are. 
Me and my team are hoping to help women become the best version of themselves!"</p>

	<h6>International media & Entertainment student, CEO Bliss</h6>
	<br>
	<p>"I am happy to be a part of Bliss because I think it is important that every woman feels comfortable in her own skin. Most women pay too much attention to others. This makes them insecure and they will think that they are not good enough. Bliss gives young women the opportunity to not focus on others, but on yourself. You will learn to love and accept yourself so that you can find your bliss. I think that is so beautiful and special about this brand. What we teach these women and their change after the retreat makes us unique!"</p>
