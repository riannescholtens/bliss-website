	<h3>Lindsay Walters story:</h3>
	
	<p2> 
		She built self-confidence and discovered her inner strength through sports.

Lindsay Walter began losing her hair in clumps when she was two years old. Within a few weeks, it was all gone. She was diagnosed with alopecia, a rare autoimmune disease that affects nearly 2% of the general population and causes total body hair loss.Growing up was tough. As a child, she hid behind wigs and was constantly bullied because she had no hair. She grew insecure and ashamed for not having any eyebrows and very few eyelashes.Despite how painful this was for her, Walter developed physical strength and agility early on, and discovered her passion for basketball.

“I would work hard at school and then just shoot in my driveway for hours, pretending to be just like everyone else, like I didn’t have Alopecia,” she said. ”I felt so alone.”

Little did she know that her new hobby would play a pivotal role in shaping the rest of her life.

“Basketball really became an outlet and helped me to cope with my alopecia, because I had that to distract myself in a positive way.”After playing basketball for several years, Walter became fascinated with running. Always up for a new challenge, she signed up for her first marathon. She began training and quickly fell in love with the sport.

“I would go on long runs by the lake and loved being outside, it was also such a great stress relief” she said. After completing her first race, she couldn’t wait to sign up for the next one.

“The feeling of the crowds cheering, crossing the finish line and being able to say ‘I’m a marathoner’ was the greatest athletic high I’ve ever experienced,” she said. “The feeling was infectious and I was hooked!”

When she runs, Walter feels empowered, like she can do anything: “I feel strong, beautiful and fierce kind of like Wonder Woman — I really feel invincible.”

Discovering her inner strength

The more she ran, the stronger and more confident Walter felt, which completely shifted her attitude and thought process. She turned her focus to all of the things she loved about herself and learned to embrace them.

Her goal was to run 27 marathons by the time she turned 27. Not only did she reach her goal, she’s just finished running her 30th race.

Today, she’s found gratitude and self-acceptance, and is determined to help support children living with alopecia.

“It’s my responsibility to show them what true strength and beauty looks like,” she says.

“We’re given things in life (in my case Alopecia) for a reason and it’s the way we respond and choose to act that make us who we are,” she said. “I’ve learned how to be strong and that I can do anything I set my mind to, hair or not.”

A dream come true

The key to success, according to Walter, is a combination of hard work and determination, but most importantly self-belief.

“It’s crazy and such a dream come true when I think of the 30 marathons I’ve run and the kids and people I’ve met through this journey,” she said.

“Alopecia really is the greatest gift I never knew I needed and I am so thankful for it!”

	<h4>The story of an insecure writer:</h4>
	<p3> The story begins now, in a room that could disguise itself as the living room of a model home. I'm sitting in a room that's empty of other people; but there are a lot of chairs, 26 to be exact, a sofa, and some more couch-like chairs. I could have a lot of friends over to my theoretical model home.

I don't know if I could even name 26 people that I'd want to be around right now. More than half of them would decline the invitation anyway. The others wouldn't come to my party, or we'd have a sad-looking get together with Lays Original chips and French Onion dip, the kind that comes in a jar, and lots of chairs.The devil on my shoulder, my insecurity, tells me that I wouldn't be a good host anyway.

You can barely hold a conversation. What would you even talk about with all two people that show up to your dumb pity party? You'd just twiddle your thumbs and stare at your shoes. You have such shitty taste in high-calorie snack foods. French onion dip and Lays chips? Really?

Before you ask, I'm used to this kind of beratement. It's an everyday thing. My insecurity visits me every day without fail. I do my best to block her out. She's a side character in my story. Not big enough to have a leading role, but still ever present. When things get messy, sometimes I'll confront her.

Sometimes.

But I'm distracted, so I forget about confronting her. My quiet model house living room has been infiltrated by people that I didn't invite. I should've been prepared for this; my living room is a public space.This is where I come to write.

This is where I struggle with the voice inside my head that feeds off of the blank page. The more white that there is on the page, the louder the voice is. Don't even start to write. It says, Your writing doesn't matter. Nothing that you do right now matters.The infiltrators left the front door open, and the autumn wind is blowing in cold air.

I'm cold, I should leave, I think, and get a sweatshirt. I should get away from the infiltrators, who I did not invite to my party.

But I don't move. I stay seated, shivering. I put on my headphones and listen to the same song over and over again, hoping to fall into some kind of creative trance.

Don't let this idea float away, I think. Don't let it escape.

Insecurity is back. What the fuck are you talking about? What are you even writing about?

I'm trying to tell them. I'm trying to write my life story. But you keep interrupting, I tell Insecurity. I can't concentrate very well with you always screaming in my ear. Now please, settle down.

My mom calls, the phone rings and I hit decline. I'm working.
	insecurity is screaming louder now. NO. STOP IT. STOP WRITING. YOUR IDEAS ARE TRASH AND NO ONE CARES. STOP. NOW.

The moment begins to feel very meta because I can hear the desperation in her voice; my insecurity is becoming insecure. One of the only ways to quiet my insecurity is to fill the white space. The less blank the page is, the quieter her voice gets.

So I continue to write, to spite my insecurity, that crazy fucking bitch.

She is a part of me. I wouldn't be who I am without her. She's taught me a lot about myself. She's been with me since my sense of self first formed, hiding around the corner, waiting for the perfect time to try and take over my entire being.</p3>
